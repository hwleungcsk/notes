<br>

  | |Analog data|Digital data|
  |---|---|---|
  |Description|Analog signal is a continuous signal which represents physical measurements.|Digital signals are discrete time signals generated by digital modulation.|
  |Example|Sound wave|Data stored in computer files|

<br><br>

##Data stored on computer
  |Computer uses 0 and 1 to store data (binary data). The more bits are used, the more combinations (patterns) can be represented (more complicated data can be stored).|
  |---|
  |E.g. If 8 bits are used for each pixel (dot) of an image, 256 different colors can be represented (Each pattern represents one color).|

##Representing negative numbers - 2's Complement
 
  ![2's complement](https://www.electrical4u.com/images/february16/1455991466.gif)

  [https://www.electrical4u.com/2s-complement/]
<br><br>

##Why 2's Complement

  > The main goal is to develop a technique which replaces a subtraction operation with an addition. In this way, we will be able to use the same circuit to perform both addition and subtraction. This will reduce the number of gates.

<br><br>

##Overflow

  > An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is **outside of the range** that can be represented with a given number of digits – either **higher than the maximum or lower than the minimum** representable value.

##Character representation

  |As computer can only store 0 and 1. Each bit pattern (combination/numeric value) is used to represent a character in computer system.|
  |---|
|Notice that even for the "same" character we could recognize (Eg. the Chinese word "一"). The representing code in different coding systems will be different.

####Unicode (All printable characters)

  |Number of bytes used for each character depends on the number of language to be supported.<br>*Eg, if only Traditional Chinese is needed, only 2 bytes will be used for each character. If both Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese are needed, 3 bytes may be needed.|

##Digitization

  > Digitization is the process of converting information into a digital format.

[https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/digitization]()
<br>

  |Audio digitization: Sound wave is a continuous data. We need to record data at specific interval (sampling rate). And use n-bits to store each data (sampling size). The higher sampling rate and sampling size means the "samples" are more similar to the original data|
|---|

[https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/speech-recognition1.htm]()
<br>

   |Image digitization: Imagine a computer divide an image into "grids". Choose the most appropriate color for each "box" (pixel). Resolution (pixels x pixels)means how many "boxes" are used to represent the image. Color depth (bits) means how many bits are used for each "box". The higher resolution and color depth means the stored image is more similar to the original image|

##Lossy and Lossless compression

|Multimedia files could be very large in size (Video files can occupy GB of data in seconds). So it is generally accepted to "loss" some data for saving video (Eg, mp4) and audio (Eg, mp3) files.<br>The lost data cannot be restored during decompression. That means the quality is degraded/reduced.|
