##Analog data and Digital data

<br>

  | |Analog data|Digital data|
  |---|---|---|
  |Description|Analog signal is a continuous signal which represents physical measurements.|Digital signals are discrete time signals generated by digital modulation.|
  |Example|Sound wave|Data stored in computer files|

<br><br>

##Data stored on computer
  |Computer uses 0 and 1 to store data (binary data). The more bits are used, the more combinations (patterns) can be represented (more complicated data can be stored).|
  |---|
  |E.g. If 8 bits are used for each pixel (dot) of an image, 256 different colors can be represented (Each pattern represents one color).|

##Representing negative numbers - 2's Complement

  [https://www.electrical4u.com/2s-complement/]
<br><br>

##Why 2's Complement

  > The main goal is to develop a technique which replaces a subtraction operation with an addition. In this way, we will be able to use the same circuit to perform both addition and subtraction. This will reduce the number of gates.

<br><br>

##Overflow

  > An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is **outside of the range** that can be represented with a given number of digits – either **higher than the maximum or lower than the minimum** representable value.

##Character representation

  |As computer can only store 0 and 1. Each bit pattern (combination/numeric value) is used to represent a character in computer system.|
  |---|
|Notice that even for the "same" character we could recognize (Eg. the Chinese word "一"). The representing code in different coding systems will be different.

####Unicode (All printable characters)

  |Number of bytes used for each character depends on the number of language to be supported.<br>*Eg, if only Traditional Chinese is needed, only 2 bytes will be used for each character. If both Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese are needed, 3 bytes may be needed.|
