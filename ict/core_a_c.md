  | |Analog data|Digital data|
  |---|---|---|
  |Description|Analog signal is a continuous signal which represents physical measurements.|Digital signals are discrete time signals generated by digital modulation.|
  |Example|Sound wave|Data stored in computer files|

##Data stored on computer
  |Computer uses 0 and 1 to store data (binary data). The more bits are used, the more combinations (patterns) can be represented (more complicated data can be stored).|
  |---|
  |E.g. If 8 bits are used for each pixel (dot) of an image, 256 different colors can be represented (Each pattern represents one color).|

##Why 2's Complement

  > The main goal is to develop a technique which replaces a subtraction operation with an addition. In this way, we will be able to use the same circuit to perform both addition and subtraction. This will reduce the number of gates.
