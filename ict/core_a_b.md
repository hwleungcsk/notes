  | |Direct Access|Sequential Access|
  |---|---|---|
  |Descrpition|Data on direct access devices can only be read in order. If data is at the "end" of the device, all previous data must be read first.|Data on sequential access devices can be accessed "immediately". Data stores at the "beginning" or "ending" part should be similar access time (No need to wait).|
  |Example|Magnetic tape|Hard disk/SSD/CD ... etc (All other storage devices)|

##Data validation

  > Data validation is the process of ensuring data have undergone data cleansing to ensure they have data quality, that is, that they are both correct and useful. It uses routines, often called "validation rules", "validation constraints", or "check routines", that check for correctness, meaningfulness, and security of data that are input to the system.

##Common types of data validation

##Data verification

  > helps to determine whether data was accurately translated when data is transferred from one source to another, is complete, and supports processes in the new system. During verification, there may be a need for a parallel run of both systems to identify areas of disparity and forestall erroneous data loss.<p>A type of Data Verification is double entry and proofreading data. Proofreading data involves someone checking the data entered against the original document.

  |In short, data verification is to make sure data is input/convert correctly|
